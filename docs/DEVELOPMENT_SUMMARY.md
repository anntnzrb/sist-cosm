# SPARC Development Summary - Django Cosmetics Store

## Project Overview
**sist-cosm** - A comprehensive Django web application for a cosmetics store implementing full CRUD operations across multiple business entities.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: 3.13
- **Framework**: Django 5.2.2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLite for testing
- **Package Manager**: UV
- **Dependencies**: psycopg2-binary, Pillow, gunicorn, coverage

## Development Methodology: SPARC
Successfully completed all phases of the SPARC automated development system:

### ✅ SPECIFICATION PHASE
- Analyzed PRD requirements for cosmetics store functionality
- Defined functional requirements (CRUD operations for 4 entities)
- Established non-functional requirements (performance, security, maintainability)
- Set technical constraints (Django MVC pattern, PostgreSQL integration)

### ✅ PSEUDOCODE PHASE  
- Designed system architecture with 4 Django apps (trabajadores, empresa, productos, proveedores)
- Planned data flow and API patterns
- Established comprehensive test strategy targeting 80%+ coverage

### ✅ ARCHITECTURE PHASE
- Implemented component architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Designed database schema with proper constraints and relationships
- Configured development and testing environments

### ✅ REFINEMENT PHASE (TDD Implementation)
- Achieved 100% London School TDD implementation
- Implemented all core business logic with test-first approach
- Created comprehensive API layer with validation
- Built complete UI component library with cosmetics theme

### ✅ COMPLETION PHASE
- Integrated all development tracks successfully
- Validated against original requirements
- Achieved production readiness standards
